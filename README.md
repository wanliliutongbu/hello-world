# hello-world
just another repository

Hi everybody!

Leo here. I like maths, but not too familar with codes. Is it strange?

So I came here and wish to learn some basic information from this platform.

I hope many of you could do me a favor. Thanks a lot for sharing the methods or ideas to do the classification without too many labels.

Thanks again!
